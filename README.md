# Face Recognition Model for Gender Identification

## Introduction:
This is a Face Recognition Model that can identify the gender of a person from their facial features. The model is trained using machine learning techniques and is capable of identifying whether a person is male or female based on the features of their face.

## Data:
The model was trained using a dataset of over 10,000 images of male and female faces. The dataset was preprocessed to ensure that all images were properly aligned and cropped to include only the face. The images were then split into training and validation sets with a ratio of 80:20.

## Face Recognition Web App:
This face recognition web app is integrated with machine learning model. Here user can upload an image and our machine learning model will detect face and predict gender (Male or Female).
